* Cases
** Case study: Scientific Computing (we know this target exists)
*** Target user: a senior physics major who knows some C, and wants to either 1) contribute to a project or 2) do some research and feed it back into a community
*** Write wiki articles instead of writing a paper.
*** http://www.scipy.org/Getting_Started
*** http://www.opensourcephysics.org/
**** Extend with projects that run on the EC2 compute cloud / GPGPUs
*** Automation of experiments / Arduino

% This slide won't build, and I can't figure out why.
% Then again, I only spent 5 minutes scratching my head

\frametitle{What could this student do?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Search: "Scientific computing"
	\item http://www.scipy.org/Getting_Started
	\item http://www.opensourcephysics.org
	\item Write wiki articles instead of writing a paper.
	\item Extend to EC2 and GPGPUs
	\item Automation of experiments (Arduino?)
	\item other ideas?
