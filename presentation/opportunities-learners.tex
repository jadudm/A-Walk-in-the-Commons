* What can your students do?
** One example (pick one - Fedora & your first-year class)
** Documentation
** Translation
** Gardening
** Bug fixing
** Testing
** Artwork/design
** Marketing/outreach
** Being active and vocal users (use open source in outreach/service projects - for instance, Mo & the Girl Scouts) / advocacy
** Legal/licensing work (very, *very* basic stuff)
** it's the non-programming skills that are usually in most need by these communities, because nobody knows about them / how to do them, so you can almost become domain "experts" in a project
** Creative repurposing - bringing a project into a new domain it wasn't necessarily originally designed for
