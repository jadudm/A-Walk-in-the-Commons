** some you may not have (Wikiotics, CivX, FreeCiv, Civicommons, Sahana, CiviCRM)
** it's not just Linux - a lot of this stuff runs on other platforms too (Windows, Mac, web-based) "no, we are not trying to get you to reinstall your computer" (but if you're interested, we're happy to help)
** the Four Freedoms (made for software)
*** Freedom / friends / ?
** creative commons (made for content)
