\section{Open Communities}
\begin{comment}
* What is open / what are open communities?
** What's open source/content?
** some projects you may have heard of (Firefox, Wikipedia, etc)
** some you may not have (Wikiotics, CivX, FreeCiv, Civicommons, Sahana, CiviCRM)
** it's not just Linux - a lot of this stuff runs on other platforms too (Windows, Mac, web-based) "no, we are not trying to get you to reinstall your computer" (but if you're interested, we're happy to help)
** the Four Freedoms (made for software)
*** Freedom / friends / ?
** creative commons (made for content)
** it's more than licensing... what's "the open source way," some characteristics of those communities (realtime transparency, etc)
